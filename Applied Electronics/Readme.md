The document titled "Applied Electronics" outlines a project involving the creation of a model for efficient production scheduling for Applied Electronics, a company that manufactures semiconductor chips. The project involves:

1. **Overview of Applied Electronics**: The company operates six production plants globally, producing semiconductor chips for various regions. The plants were initially designed to meet local demand but now have the potential to supply chips internationally.

2. **Production Details**: The document provides specific details about each plant's capacity, production costs, and current production plans. It also includes data on demand in each region, production costs per box of chips, and additional costs such as import duties and shipping costs.

3. **Assignment Objective**: The goal is to create a plan that minimizes total costs, including production, duties, and shipping. The document discusses the use of Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM) for this purpose and outlines specific tasks to be completed in the assignment.

4. **Restrictions and Requirements**: The document emphasizes the importance of not relying on web-searched algorithms for VAM, encouraging original programming solutions. It also specifies the requirements for a presentation deck to be submitted, detailing the data structure, algorithm implementation, and cost savings analysis.

5. **Scenarios for Analysis**: Various scenarios are presented for analysis, such as maximizing production capacity, operating at a reduced capacity, and creating a plan that excludes the Chile plant.

6. **Data File Mention**: The document refers to a spreadsheet titled "Applied Electronics Data.xlsx" containing relevant data.

This summary provides an overview of the project's scope and objectives. The next step is to write a README.md file for the project, integrating this information with the Python code in 'Project1_Final.py'.

# README.md for Applied Electronics Project

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a production scheduling model for Applied Electronics, a company that produces semiconductor chips. The model aims to optimize the production levels across six global plants, considering production costs, import duties, and shipping costs.

## Objective
Create an efficient production plan that minimizes total costs while fulfilling global demand. The plan should factor in local and international shipping costs, import duties, and varying production costs across different plants.

## Data
The project utilizes data from "Applied Electronics Data.xlsx," which includes plant capacities, production plans, demand in each region, and cost details.

## Methodology
- Use Vogel’s Approximation Method (VAM) to develop the production plan.
- Analyze different scenarios including maximizing plant capacities and operating at reduced capacities.

## Assignment Tasks
1. **Data Structure Definition**: Establish how Applied Electronics will provide data to the algorithm.
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement VAM in the project and describe the logic in the presentation deck.
3. **Cost Analysis**: Compare the cost savings of the VAM plan against the current plan.
4. **Capacity Utilization Scenarios**: Assess plans using different plant capacity limits.
5. **Alternate Plans**: Explore scenarios excluding specific plants (e.g., the Chile plant) and analyze the cost implications.

## Restrictions
This assignment emphasizes original programming solutions for VAM without relying on pre-existing web algorithms.

## Deliverables
- A presentation deck detailing the algorithm, data structure, and analysis.
- Python code implementing the VAM for the production scheduling problem.
