# README.md for Regency Bank Client Selection Project

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a simulation model for Regency Bank to evaluate the acquisition of a professional card portfolio from Continental Bank. The main challenge is to determine the optimal strategy for client migration based on financial and risk considerations.

## Objective
To create a model that assesses the attractiveness of potential clients over three years, considering risk levels, complexity, and size. The model will guide decisions on which clients to migrate to maximize profitability and minimize risk.

## Data
- The portfolio consists of 210 clients with varying risk ratings and complexity levels.
- Data includes total spend, number of cards per client, and growth projections.

## Methodology
1. **Simulation Model Development**: Construct a model to evaluate each client's financial impact over three years.
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Simulate different policies for migration based on risk, complexity, and size to find the best strategy.
3. **Risk-Level Evaluation**: Determine the optimal risk level for client migration.

## Assignment Tasks
1. Describe a simulation model for evaluating individual clients.
2. Build a three-year simulation model for the decision to migrate all potential clients.
3. Assess the best risk level for migration and its impact compared to migrating all clients.
4. Develop a simulation experiment to consider different migration policies based on risk, complexity, and size.

## Deliverables
- A comprehensive simulation model in Python.
- Detailed analysis and findings report.
