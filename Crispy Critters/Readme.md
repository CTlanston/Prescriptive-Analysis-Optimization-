# README.md for Crispy Critters Project

## Project Overview
This project supports Crispy Critters Inc., a biotech startup focused on producing genetically engineered critters capable of disassembling and decomposing abandoned automobiles. The challenge lies in managing two types of critters: the beneficial car-eating critters and the harmful critters that consume the beneficial ones.

## Objective
To develop an optimal production process that maximizes the yield of beneficial critters while minimizing the growth of harmful ones. This involves choosing the right combination of growth environments and chemical agents for processing.

## Data
- **Growth Environments (A and B)**: Different yields and costs for critter production.
- **Chemical Agents**: Two types of agents for processing the critters, each with unique costs and effectiveness.

## Methodology
1. **Linear Programming Formulation**: Develop a comprehensive LP model to determine the optimal mix of environments and agents.
2. **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluate the impact of changes in key parameters like harvest yield, critter composition requirements, and staffing levels.

## Assignment Tasks
1. Implement the LP formulation in Python.
2. Create presentation slides for the production department, detailing raw material procurement and technician scheduling.
3. Analyze sensitivity of objective coefficients and shadow prices.
4. Investigate the impact of improved harvest yields.
5. Assess the effects of changing the composition requirements for the final product.
6. Explore the implications of increasing staffing levels in harvesting and baking departments.

## Deliverables
- A Python implementation of the LP model.
- Presentation slides explaining the optimal solution.
- Sensitivity analysis and impact assessment reports.
